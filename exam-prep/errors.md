# Exam preparation errors

### World Cup

- Used `Gmpz` rather than `Gmpq` for variable type
- Indexed variables with `n*i+m*j` rather than `m*i+j`
- Divided per 100 on variables side rather than multiplying per 100 on constant side
- Used `int` type rather than `double` for 0.01 revenue decreases when crossing circle line
- Tried some weird geometry rather than `Delaunay` for last constraint
